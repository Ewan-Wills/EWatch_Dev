# EWatchOS2.1 notes

## 2026-10-05 - serial/render trap audit (traps A-E from bookreader)

Changed:
- Root fix for top/left text clipping (all views): GFX 1.4.9 drawChar, both
  GFXfont and the built-in glcdfont, only skips a glyph that is entirely
  off-screen; a partly-off glyph writes at negative x/y, before the canvas
  framebuffer (heap corruption). `src/drivers/safe_canvas.h` (SafeCanvas)
  clips every canvas write path; frameCanvas() and viewer3d use it. The audit
  found quickset's scrolling header (y=36..40+rise) hitting this; it needs no
  local guard now.
- `src/core/ewlog.cpp` `log dump`: held sLogMutex across the whole 256 KB
  Serial dump. With a host that isn't draining, each HWCDC write can block
  ~100 ms, so every task that logs would stall (trap E). The mutex is now
  taken per 256 B chunk (open/seek/read) and released before Serial.write.

Audited, no change needed:
- Trap A/B/C: the only Serial reader in the OS is the ewcon console itself.
  No OS view runs a PC protocol over Serial (photos upload via the web UI).
- Trap D, custom fonts: watchface Photo face (FreeSansBold24, baseline 96,
  top 61) and Mono face (FreeMono24, baseline 120) are in bounds;
  drawTitleBar draws FreeSans12/FreeMono12 at baseline >= 24 on the panel
  (gfx, not the canvas). Launcher already guards its scrolling text.
- Trap E: other locks (ModelLock, spotify art/spMutex, photo_store,
  wifi scan/job, storage known-list) are held only for short copies; the
  spotify art download runs outside artMutex.
Not flashed or tested on hardware.
